Blog Posts API
===============
Use the Blogs API to create and manage blog posts for a NationBuilder blog.

Index Endpoint
--------------
Show a list of the posts a blog has in the system
GET /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/blogs/:blog_id/posts

### Attributes
* page - page number
* per_page - number of results to display per page (max 100)

### Example

If you make a request like this:

```
GET https://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/pages/blogs/10/posts
```

Then you should get a 200 response with a body like this:

```json

  "per_page": 10,
  "total": 2,
  "results": [

      "site_slug": "foobar",
      "name": "Will Wars",
      "headline": "Will Wars",
      "title": "Will Wars - Foobar Softwares",
      "excerpt": null,
      "author_id": 5,
      "external_id": null,
      "id": 10,
      "content_before_flip": "<p>Psychopathy is more common than you would expect</p>"
    },
    {
      "slug": "perspective_misalignments",
      "status": "published",
      "site_slug": "foobar",

Match Endpoint
--------------
Map an external service id to a NationBuilder blog post id
GET /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/blogs/:blog_id/posts/match

### Attributes
* external_id - the external id

### Example
I have a wordpress blog that I have imported into NationBuilder via this API, and I want to edit one of the posts that was imported, to which I had attached the external id "wp_1234".  To edit the page I need the NationBuilder id, but I did not write it down.  To overcome this lack of information I can issue a request like this:

```
GET https://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/blogs/13/posts/match?external_id=wp_1234
```

And get back a response like this:

```json
{
  "id": 15
}
```

Show Endpoint
-------------
Show the details of an individual blog post, including the content after the page change
GET /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/blogs/:blog_id/posts/:id

### Example

When you make a request like this:

```
GET https:///foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/pages/blogs/10/posts/11
```

Then you should get a 200 response with a body like this:

```json

  "blog_post": {
    "slug": "perspective_misalignments",
    "status": "published",
    "author_id": 5,

}
```
