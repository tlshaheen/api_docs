```json
{
  "basic_page": {

    "content": "<p>My page content</p>",
    "status": "published"
  }
}
```

You should get a 200 response with a body like this:
```json
{
  "basic_page": {
    "slug": "my_page",
    "status": "published",
    "site_slug": "foobar",

    "headline": "My Page",
    "title": "My Page - Foobar Softwares",
    "excerpt": null,
    "id": 12,
    "content": "<p>My page content</p>"
  }
}
```

Then a new basic page will be entered into NationBuilder, and available to view immediately

Update Endpoint
---------------

Update the attributes of a basic page.  Note that this is an update of all properties of the page, partial updates are not supported.
PUT /api/v1/sites/:site_slug/pages/basic_pages/:id

### Example

Suppose you wanted to change the title of the page made in the documentation for the Create endpoint to be "New Title".  To do this, you would issue a request like this:

```
PUT http://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/pages/basic_pages/12
```

With a body like this:

```json
{
  "basic_page": {
    "slug": "my_page",
    "status": "published",
    "name": "My Page",
    "headline": "My Page",
    "title": "New Title",
    "excerpt": null,
    "content": "<p>My page content</p>"
  }
}
```

That should update the page to have the new title, and return a response code of 200 with body like this:

```json
{
  "basic_page": {
    "slug": "my_page",
    "status": "published",
    "site_slug": "foobar",
    "name": "My Page",
    "headline": "My Page",
    "title": "New Title",
    "excerpt": null,
    "id": 12,
    "content": "<p>My page content</p>"
  }
}
```

### Example

Issuing a request like this:

```
DELETE http://foobar.nationbuilder.com/api/v1/sites/foobar/pages/basic_pages/12
```

Should remove the page from NationBuilder and respond with HTTP status code 204.
